# Oral Examiner

This code was written in preparation for an oral examination during my postgraduate studies at Heidelberg University. The program simulates an oral exam, using lists of questions stored in Markdown (.md) files. Proper formatting of the questions is illustrated in the example file *questions.md*. Questions appear in randomized order. Current progress of an exam can be saved so that it can be resumed later.

*TODO: Add option of adding own answers in the .md files.*
